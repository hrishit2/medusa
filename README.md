🚀 Medusa Backend Deployment on AWS ECS Fargate
This project demonstrates how to containerize, provision infrastructure, and automate deployment of the Medusa backend using:

Docker (for building the image)

Terraform (for creating AWS infrastructure)

GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

AWS ECS Fargate (for hosting the container)

📁 Repository Structure
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the Medusa backend.

Terraform configuration files.

main.tf: AWS infrastructure setup (ECS, IAM, VPC, etc.)

variables.tf: Input variables used in Terraform

outputs.tf: Outputs used by GitHub Actions

terraform.tfvars: Actual values for your deployment

Dockerfile
Used to build the Docker image for the Medusa backend.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Medusa (Node.js headless commerce backend)

Docker & Docker Hub

AWS ECS Fargate

Terraform

GitHub Actions

🚧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have:

AWS account with programmatic access enabled

Docker Hub account with a repository created

GitHub repository secrets configured:

DOCKERHUB_USERNAME

DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

AWS_REGION

📦 Dockerfile Purpose
The Dockerfile contains instructions to:

Set up the Node.js environment

Install dependencies

Build the Medusa project

Expose the necessary port

Start the backend server

This file ensures the Medusa backend runs properly inside a container.

📐 Terraform Configuration
Terraform is used to create and manage:

A virtual private cloud (VPC) and subnets

ECS cluster and Fargate service

IAM roles and permissions

CloudWatch logging for ECS

Security groups and networking

You run terraform init and terraform apply to deploy infrastructure.

⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow
The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow performs the following:

Checks out your repository

Sets up Docker and logs into Docker Hub

Builds and pushes the Medusa Docker image to Docker Hub

Configures AWS credentials

Triggers a new ECS deployment to pull the latest image

This ensures your application is deployed every time you push to the main branch.

🚀 Deployment Flow
You push changes to the main branch.

GitHub Actions builds the Docker image.

The image is pushed to Docker Hub.

AWS ECS service is updated to pull the latest image.

The Medusa backend is deployed on Fargate.

🌐 Accessing the Backend
If your service is deployed with a public IP:

Go to the ECS Console

Navigate to your running task

Copy the public IP address

Access your backend via http://<public-ip>:9000

📹 Deliverables
To complete the project, you should have:

A public GitHub repository containing:

Terraform code

Dockerfile

GitHub Actions workflow

A deployed Medusa backend running in ECS

A video walkthrough showing:

Code explanation

Deployment steps

Running backend demo

🐛 Troubleshooting Tips
If the GitHub Actions job fails, check logs for Docker or AWS CLI errors.

If the ECS service doesn’t update, verify IAM permissions and ECS names.

If the container crashes, review logs in AWS CloudWatch.

Ensure public subnet and security group allow inbound traffic on port 9000.
